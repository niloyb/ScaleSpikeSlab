# ScaleSpikeSlab (S^3)

This package contains algorithms for *Scalable Spike-and-Slab* (S^3), a scalable Gibbs sampling implementation for high dimensional Bayesian regression with the continuous spike-and-slab prior. 

It is based on the article "Scalable Spike-and-Slab", by Niloy Biswas, Lester Mackey and Xiao-Li Meng. 

The folder `R_package` contains the software package `ScaleSpikeSlab` in R.

The folder `Python_package` contains the software package `ScaleSpikeSlab` in Python (forthcoming).
